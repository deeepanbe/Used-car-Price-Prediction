Used Cars Price Prediction
Welcome to the "Used Cars Price Prediction" project repository! This project aims to develop a predictive model for determining the selling price of used cars based on various features. The model will help optimize revenue for a car resell startup by providing accurate price predictions.

Project Overview
With India's used car market set to grow significantly, this project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the prices of second-hand cars. The project's objective is to create the best-performing model and identify the most important features influencing the price.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

Id: Unique ID assigned to a specific car.

Year: Manufacture year of the car.

Brand: Brand of the car.

Full Model Name: Detailed model name including engine capacity, transmission, etc.

Model Name: Model name of the car.

Price: Sell price of the 2nd ownership car.

Distance Travelled (km): Distance traveled by the car.

Fuel Type: Type of fuel used by the car.

City: City where the car is registered.

Car Age: Age of the car.

Steps and Tasks
Import Libraries and Load Dataset: Load the necessary libraries and the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate Analysis: Understand the distribution of individual features.

Multivariate Analysis: Determine correlations between features.

Layout Regression Experiment Space: Set up the experiment space for regression models.

Model Performance Evaluation: Publish the performance of all models on the same hold-out/test dataset.

Feature Importance: Identify the most important features determining the price of used cars.
